Technology has revolutionized the traditional market.  Thankfully your land has been prosperous and you're poised to take advantage of this new fast paced trading.\n
\n
Instructions\n
\n
Required Materials:\n
Physical Settlers of Catan board game\n
A “Button” (usually a bottle cap) for tracking robber placements\n
\n
Expansion Rules:\n
This expansion is designed to work with a physical copy of Settlers of Catan.  Except where discussed below, Opening Bell uses the same instructions as the basic Settlers of Catan game.\n
\n
Rolling Dice:\n
Opening Bell removes the standard turn structure.  Instead of rolling dice on each player's turn, the dice are rolled automatically on a timer.  \n
\n
Resource Collection:\n
Resources are available for collecting directly after the dice have been rolled.  If a player does not collect their resource before the next roll, they've forfeited that resource.\n
\n
Building and Purchasing Development Cards:\n
Players may build at any point following the steps below.\n
1.  The player must already possess the required materials before building can begin.\n
2.  Declare an intent to build or purchase out loud. Include the build location(s). “I'm going to build 2 roads here and here.”\n
3.  If two players want to build at the same time and the builds are in conflict, the player who declared an intent first has priority.\n
\n
Rolling 7's:\n
When a 7 is rolled, the player who has the button in front of them passes the button to their left and then moves the robber using the robber placement instructions from the basic Settlers of Catan game.\n
For hand size, don't count any resources allocated to a declared build/purchase before the 7 was rolled.  Discard resources as usual.\n
\n
Development Cards:\n
With the exception of development cards containing a victory point, all development cards must be held for at least 2 rolls of the dice before they can be played.\n\n
